Each folder contains the Code Composer Studio Project Folder for each respective sensor (light, gas, and motion) and the entire home system, which combines each sensor into one.

Running the code in code composer studio with the expressions window open should display values representing what the sensore detects (like temperature, whether or not the device detects motion, etc.).
